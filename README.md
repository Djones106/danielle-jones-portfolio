CodeLouisville Project Final

This portfolio is the templete that I plan to use to show chase the projects that I have created. The three features I have completed are for CSS - used Flexbox to organize my project content to change based on the screen size. For JavaScript the contact form is used to validate the name, email, and message. If the user does not provide a valid email/name/message an alert will ask to provide valid information. If the user enters valid information they are sent to a Thank you page with a return link. Addtional item is CSS animation to with a slide in profile at load. 

Thank you for this opportunity and for great mentors!
